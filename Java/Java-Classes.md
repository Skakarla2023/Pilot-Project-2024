# OOPS

- OOP in java stands for Object oriented programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

A class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.

When the individual objects are created, they inherit all the variables and methods from the class.
